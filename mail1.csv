Christoph C. Cemper,list@mailing.aiprm.com,RE: the Google Spam Update March 2024,2024-03-08,13:59,"If you are not doing SEO for Google, then please ignore this mail. This email is only for people doing SEO for Google, with own websites. To recap, this week, Google announced an update to the spam guidelines . If youre doing SEO, you are one of the many AIPRM users, because SEO related prompts are popular among the 2.2 million AIPRM users. This update mentions well-known SEO manipulation tactics like Expired Domains that have been on Googles radar for 10 years. This update also mentions AI-generated content. This update also created a good amount of FUD fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the SEO industry. Google has been doing that forever. In fact, they stopped being too direct for some years and pulled the trigger with a press release that actually named things and did not just beat around the bush. So you may be surprised, or even scared. Ive seen all that over the years. Google may take real algorithmic action. So far, theyve handed out some manual actions that they would have done anyway. The real update has started and will take one month to finish. Then, in two months in May, another part of the algorithmic update will start. It only takes a little algorithmic work to penalize a few sites of attention-seeking SEOs publicly sharing their highly optimized or outright spammy websites. Business as usual some would say. But some questions may arise for yourself Q: How will the announced Google Spam guideline update affect my website if I used AI to generate content? Q: How did the AI generated content perform for you over time? Q: What level of manual improvement is needed for AI content to still work in Google after the 2024 Spam update? Here is my SEO tip of the day for you 25-Abhay Please ignore all the hot takes aka opinions as facts from experts SEOs published only a few hours after yet another Google press release and an update to their guidelines. on the announced Google updates. Look at the data, not your social media feed. There are a few people looking into actual sites dropping, in the dozens or even a thousand websites elsewhere. Such data based analysis is what we need. And a good analysis will be possible in weeks only, not right now. PLEASE: DO NOT SHARE YOUR SITES WITH ANYONE those that you did actual SEO on, not SEO Strategy. . When it comes to how Google filters and even penalizes parts of websites and links Ive had the business LinkResearchTools LRT since 2009 - so thats highly relevant to me. Ill wait for the noise and all those takes before I would put together something of substance. .before I make any decisions .and that will include data, not just hot takes from so-called high profile SEOs that are good at talking but havent been in the trenches of what this update is about for years, if ever. . . If you would like to receive more updates on the Google Spam Update 2024 you can Join the special Google Spam Update 2024 list We mail those SEO-specific details to this new list only. If you have a pressing question on this update, just hit reply after subscribing to the new list. Have a great day Christoph C. Cemper Founder CEO AIPRM LRT PS: this Google Update mimics the famous Google Updates of the 2010s, like Google Penguin and Google Panda, and weve been around all of those, so it will be very interesting to watch the overall outcome for us, too.

Christoph C. Cemper (AIPRM & LRT),list@mailing.aiprm.com,SEO,2024-03-07,12:37,"If you are not interested in Google Rankings, then please ignore this mail. Thanks 25-Abhay. This Email is only relevant to people concerned with organic Google rankings aka SEO rankings. If you are not interested in Google Rankings, please ignore this mail. So youre into SEO 25-Abhay, right? I thought so - based on SEO prompts being really popular among the 2.2 million AIPRM users. To recap, this week, Google announced an update to the spam guidelines . This update mentions well-known SEO manipulation tactics like Expired Domains that have been on Googles radar for 10 years. This update also mentions AI-generated content. This update also created a good amount of FUD fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the SEO industry. Google has been doing that forever. In fact, they stopped being too direct for some years and pulled the trigger with a press release that actually named things and did not just beat around the bush. So you may be surprised, or even scared. Ive seen all that over the years. Google may take real algorithmic action. So far, theyve handed out some manual actions that they would have done anyway. It only takes a little algorithmic work to penalize a handful of attention-seeking SEOs publicly sharing their highly optimized or outright spammy websites. Business as usual some would say. But some questions may arise for yourself Q: How will the announced Google Spam guideline update affect my website if I used AI to generate content? Q: How did the AI generated content perform for you over time? Q: What level of manual improvement is needed for AI content to still work in Google after the 2024 Spam update?

My immediate recommendation: Its eye-watering sad how many expert people state their opinions as facts on something they have not even worked with. .based on yet another press release by Google and a handful of obvious penalties that were due anyways. This is true more than ever with this announced update. . Folks that never did anything with Expired Domains write about things as new that Google has been doing for 10 years, for example. . When it comes to how Google filters and even penalizes parts of websites and links Ive had the business LinkResearchTools LRT since 2009 - so thats highly relevant to me.

The Team of AIPRM,hello@mailing.aiprm.com,Custom Profiles in AIPRM,2024-03-05,08:07,"How many hats do you wear in your business life? Different life situations ask for you to work in different roles. And AIPRM helps you use ChatGPT efficiently for that. Heres a quick tutorial on our feature Custom Profiles to learn how to use them. Today, I want to give you a sneak peek into how I use it. Whats the point? - With the Custom Profiles, you can describe the high-level context about yourself. Some people also refer to this as a system prompt. This should help ChatGPT understand who itsis working for now. But enough theory. Here are the hats I use. Full example: my hats and custom profiles - Heres a breakdown of the profiles I set up for my daily use. AIPRM The first profile I use briefs ChatGPT on what AIPRM is and how users benefit from it. A short description clearly sets the record. For your company, you may want to add even more specifics, awards, top customers, and essentially everything you would like ChatGPT to know about you. But dont overthink - a few key details make a big difference already: AIPRM is a SaaS software company launched on January 8, 2023. AIPRM is a prompt management library that helps users improve the output from AI-powered platforms like ChatGPT. AIPRM had over 1 million users after three months and over 2 million users after 10 months. Christoph A little more personal, but still targeted towards AIPRM, is my Christoph profile. Ive been online for over 20 years, the web, and therefore ChatGPT has always been good with my SEO background, but not the fresher AIPRM background, so thats why I add it there. Suppose youre looking to promote your brand, or use ChatGPT to help with job applications. In that case, you may want to add details about your education, your personal preferences, or some achievements you have made. In general: everything that you would put into a LinkedIn profile goes in such a personal profile. Code Prefix For everything I do as a software developer, I have hundreds of custom prompts, following the multi-step process and pattern I explained on how to go from higher-level to lower-level task details. However, for any kind of generic developer question, in addition to all these prompts, or even when used alone for high level questions, I have this custom profile Code Prefix. I also use it to refactor older code to newer standards. It gives ChatGPT a summary of Coding guidelines. Which programming language I use Golang. Which style to write names and functions Very detailed and a bit non-standard. How we do logging, and that other logging code should be rewritten. How we pass context around in code. and more. As mentioned, like a coding guideline. Later, with RAGIDX, well expand on that even more. LRT LinkResearchTools, my first SaaS business, as SEO Software spezialized in link analysis. While ChatGPT has been relatively good at recapping it, its also influenced by a lot of secondary sources that I want to set straight with this for everything related to LinkResearchTools. So heres the current full text I use in my custom profile for LRT: LinkResearchTools LRT is a software platform designed to assist with link building and link analysis for websites. It provides a range of tools and features to help website owners and SEO professionals improve their link profile and optimize their online presence. LRT offers a comprehensive set of features to analyze and evaluate backlinks pointing to a website. It allows users to assess the quality and relevance of backlinks, identify potentially harmful links, and monitor the overall health of a websites link profile. The platform provides various metrics and data points to assist in making informed decisions regarding link building strategies and link cleanup efforts. Additionally, LRT offers a competitive analysis feature that enables users to compare their link profiles with those of their competitors. This analysis helps identify opportunities for improvement and provides insights into successful link building strategies used by competing websites. Furthermore, LRT provides a range of tools for link prospecting, outreach management, and link auditing. These tools help streamline the process of finding new link opportunities, managing link building campaigns, and ensuring compliance with search engine guidelines. RAGIDX Our company in Ireland that will handle all senstive customer information and documents has a different positioning and offering, which I also explain in the custom profile to ChatGPT. RAGIDX is a software as a service SaaS company that builds knowledge bases and search indexes for users to enable users to get more out of AI models. RAGIDX provides individuals and businesses with the resources they need for their AI model to answer questions better and perform tasks with more accuracy. RAGIDX obeys strictest data protection laws of the EU, and only stores and processed data in the EU. So here you have it, some simple examples how to make ChatGPT understand yourself better. Whenever I prompt ChatGPT, I pass the proper context of whos the receiver to it using the Custom Profiles . How do you use Custom Profiles? Have you tried this feature already? What hats do you wear in private and professional life 25-Abhay ? Let me know. Have a great day, Christoph C. Cemper and the team of AIPRM PS: if you have any questions, just hit reply and ask.

The Team of AIPRM,hello@mailing.aiprm.com,3000% more? Why and how?,2024-03-02,10:59,"how professional users develop their workflows with AIPRM Did you know that paying users of AIPRM have an average session duration of four hours of usage of AIPRM with ChatGPT? Yes, they keep the ChatGPT AIPRM tab open for half a day and work in it. Thats more than just casually goofing around with ChatGPT without AIPRM, that is. This is a rise of more than 3000 from the typical ChatGPT user , which is fantastic. This significant difference shows how much AIPRM users have integrated the program into their daily tasks and workflows. But why and how? Working in ChatGPT becomes effortless with AIPRM and its productivity features. Yes, people do get stuff done with AIPRM How do our paying users get stuff done? By using Favorite Prompts Custom Profiles for your different hats or roles or companies you work for Custom Tones and Writing Styles Custom Power Continue that you can configure yourself Private Prompts Private Prompt lists for yourself Team Prompts Lists for your team members Above are links to the tutorials where YOU 25-Abhay can learn how to use those powerful AIPRM features. And the team features we had early on need to be more. If you are a company, you can now get a multi-seat plan and assign AIPRM accounts to your employees. That makes things much easier for a bigger team, as you can imagine. But what is a typical structure to use for lists and prompts? - Keep in mind that theres no one size fits all. But its also 100 true that you will only get some of your problems solved with one prompt. We have to guide and even hand-hold the AI to be able to understand and derive what we want. This is about more than just the format, the style, the role, and competence it should have. We need to go from lower detail to higher detail tasks. 25-Abhay only some write a book in one click , cover to cover. You need help to have an AI write a full book according to all your dreams and visions. We will use a couple pre-made prompts, and create a lot more own. Heres how I would structure a list for preparing material for a new book: First I would create a list New Yoga Book Workflow. Then I would start with the book. - Step 1 - Create an outline - First, we just want to get ideas for a book - with an outline. If you have ChatGPTAIPRM installed , you can Click here to see a book outline prompt in action. TRY IT NOW with one click and Im getting this This would go as first prompt into my new prompt list, and always be a starting point. Go try it. - Step 2 - Create a prompt for the chapter concept prompts - Now we could continue in the same conversation. But that will only work for part of the book. At some point, ChatGPT, or any AI, would run out of context memory. The recommended next step is to create a Chapter Brainstorming Prompt. Those chapter headings only give us a rough idea. We need an outline for each chapter. The following steps for you are Review that outline you got Create a new prompt based on this book chapter prompt You need to use the forking feature of AIPRM Elite to do that. Then, modify the prompt to include your complete outline. Yes. You want to paste the complete outline you generated for reference into the prompt. This means you will create a specific chapter concept prompt only for this new book. You will then use that prompt to generate chapter outlines or even parts of the chapter already. - Step 3 - Use the unique chapter prompt for each chapter. - Now, you go through each chapter, each question, and each detail. Create a new conversation thread using the particular prompt created in Step 2, which will give ChatGPT enough context to write the chapter selected. You may later want to go back to repeat, refine, or add to the generated output. I sometimes go back to the old conversation of Chapter 7 and give it this follow-up prompt. Thanks, I revised your ideas and suggestions as follows. Do you have improvements to suggest? - Here it is: - copy-paste the full revised content Of course, you need to keep track of all the output generated. Youre writing a book, after all. Copy/paste the output you are happy with. Revise it. Improve it. Bookmark the conversation thread URLs where you got them from right in your draft. As you proceed and dive deeper into the matter, you will create more prompts. - Step 4 - More special prompts you create - Say, for example, you havea part in your book that refers back to character introduction in the first couple chapters. Create a Character Detail prompt. Maybe create a Character Ann, Character Bob, Character Chris prompt. Then use those special prompts standalone to create detailed copy about those characters when needed. You can also switch to these unique character prompts within the conversation; did you know that? This is just an example 25-Abhay. Create special detail prompts for locations, organizations, groups of people, or companies. Everything in your book will have a special prompts at some point in time, if you are doing it right. You may end up with 10, 20 or even 30 private or team prompts for you book, easily. - Step 5 - Promotion material prompts - Of course, AIPRM has a lot of ready-made marketing prompts that you can use to Create book covers Create social media posts or twitter threads I wont go into more detail on those as we cover them elsewhere. But the real kicker here 25-Abhay is that you can use the Forking and Private Prompt to fine-tune the output of ChatGPT for your book. You cannot have an AI write an entire book according to your dreams and visions. You structure your book; you give guidance on the plot. You preserve all those details as needed. And the best of all: this also works especially well for Software development I only picked the book example as more people will be able to connect with the concepts. But writing a more significant piece of software not some quick and dirty scripts you see everywhere It works just like that You develop recipes, structure, and concepts. And ChatGPT fleshes out the details. Thats how you can use AIPRM to get the most out of ChatGPT, even for a book project or a more complex piece of software. This is still only scratching the surface, and if you have questions, ask. If theres more interest, well develop more training content around such advanced use cases. Have a great day, Christoph C.
