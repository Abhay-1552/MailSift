The Team of AIPRM,hello@mailing.aiprm.com,product limits,2024-01-31,18:26,"Hi 25-Abhay We would like to inform you about some important updates regarding the use of private prompts in AIPRM. As you may be aware, AIPRM has always strived to provide exceptional service and a seamless experience for our users. In line with our commitment to maintaining a fair and sustainable platform, we have recently enforced the private prompt limits as outlined in the plans introduced in March 2023. For a significant period, nearly a year since our inception, we allowed early users the flexibility to exceed the private prompt usage limits for existing prompts without needing to upgrade their plan. This was our way of thanking you for your early support and trust in our service. However, to ensure the longevity and quality of our services, weve had to align with the original plan specifications. If youve noticed that some of your private prompts are no longer visible, its likely a result of these recent adjustments. This change is particularly relevant if there has been a cancellation or downgrade in your subscription. In such cases, the access to private prompts is now aligned with your current plans limitations. We understand that this transition might be an inconvenience to some, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption this may cause in your workflow. Our team is dedicated to supporting you through this adjustment. If you find that your current plan no longer meets your needs, we encourage you to consider the different plans we offer, which are designed to cater to a range of usage requirements. Your feedback and satisfaction are incredibly important to us. If you have any questions, concerns, or need assistance in choosing a plan that best fits your needs, please dont hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. Heres our official FAQ page with details. We are here to help and ensure that your experience with AIPRM continues to be productive and enjoyable.

Clone a Prompt for your Own Prompts. More lists, private prompts, and custom writing styles. A second license for your partner. And soon AIPRM Cockpit And soon, the Custom Index feature will feed your knowledge base or documents to the AI A word on the Custom Index feature coming up: this will not be for the proverbial PDF to chat with. .Custom Index is created from and for hundreds of pages of documentation or websites for you. The price for this goes from 79 to 99 on January 8 for new purchases. You get the best deal when you buy for a year and lock in the price. Take the chance. The image below that says it all. My recommendation 25-Abhay: If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan, then do so soon and lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices before theyre gone. The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to lock in the current old price.

Christoph C. Cemper (AIPRM),hello@mailing.aiprm.com,last couple days,2024-01-03,16:24,"Hey 25-Abhay Do you enjoy your winter holidays, like we do? Heres a quick reminder about prices for new purchases of AIPRM premium plans going up on Jan 8. Lock in the old price before January 8 You get the best deal, when you buy for a year. Get AIPRM Elite to view the Prompt Source with 1-Click. Clone them for your Own Prompts. More lists, private prompts, and custom writing styles. A second license for your partner. And soon the AIPRM Elite plan includes: AIPRM Cockpit Price for this goes from 79 to 99 on January 8 for new purchases. Dont miss it. The image that says it all. My recommendation 25-Abhay: If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan, then do so soon to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan. SECURE THE OLD PRICE HERE but before Jan 8 Have a great day, Christoph Founder CEO AIPRM 25-Abhay Thanks so much for your interest in AIPRM. We hope you like it Christoph_C._Cemper_really_cute_robot_heart_eyes_disney_style_c_f91111f0-13f4-4ecc-8a02-86d62a2cdac4 If youve already considered upgrading to a paid plan, then this mail is for you. AIPRMs prices are going up soon, on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM. If youve not yet considered upgrading, this may be important. If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, thats OK, too, we still love you This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid accounts. AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that will make your life easier and more productive, and were just getting started. When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have in store by watching some of the videos here , you get an idea. However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing. But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices before theyre gone. The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to lock in the current old price. This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower cost for as long as you remain a subscriber. And we would be very thankful for your support. Heres what you need to know: New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8 2024. By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.

Meetup,info@email.meetup.com,Connections: A new feature for friendship ,2023-12-20,20:04,"Stay connected between events Announcing ConnectionsA new way to make friends At Meetup, we think making friends should be easy. Thats why weve launched Connections, a new tool designed to help people stay in touch after an event. The Connections feature is a private contact list of people youd like to get to know and attend future events with. How the Connections feature works: Say you get along with someone at a Meetup event. Once the event is over, Meetup will prompt you to connect with fellow attendees. If you select an attendee and they also select you, youll become each others connection. By connecting on Meetup, you and another person have indicated you want to attend future events together. With Connections, youll get event recommendations from people who know what you like. Meet, select, connect. Then attend more events together. Fast-track friendshipfind your next event and start connecting Start connecting You received this message because you are a registered member of Meetup. Unsubscribe from this type of email.

Christoph C. Cemper (AIPRM),hello@mailing.aiprm.com,last day,2023-12-20,17:28,"I forgot to mention 25-Abhay: Today December 20 is the last day for you to get another discount for the AIPRM for subscription lifetime. You can use code WINTERLEET17 for 17 off on the monthly AIPRM Elite plan, from the old price. If you go for a year, it comes down to 31 off even. Then the regular old price of 79 will be around, until Jan 8. USE THAT CODE HERE after login Have a great day, Christoph Founder CEO AIPRM Here is the image that says it all. My recommendation 25-Abhay: If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan, then do so soon to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan. SECURE THE OLD PRICE HERE but before Jan 8 Have a great day, Christoph Founder CEO AIPRM 25-Abhay Thanks so much for your interest in AIPRM. We hope you like it Christoph_C._Cemper_really_cute_robot_heart_eyes_disney_style_c_f91111f0-13f4-4ecc-8a02-86d62a2cdac4 If youve already considered upgrading to a paid plan, then this mail is for you. AIPRMs prices are going up soon, on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM. If youve not yet considered upgrading, this may be important. If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, thats OK, too, we still love you This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid accounts. AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that will make your life easier and more productive, and were just getting started.
