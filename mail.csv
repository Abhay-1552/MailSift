The Team of AIPRM,hello@mailing.aiprm.com,product limits,2024-01-31,18:26,"Hi 25-Abhay We would like to inform you about some important updates regarding the use of private prompts in AIPRM. As you may be aware, AIPRM has always strived to provide exceptional service and a seamless experience for our users. In line with our commitment to maintaining a fair and sustainable platform, we have recently enforced the private prompt limits as outlined in the plans introduced in March 2023. For a significant period, nearly a year since our inception, we allowed early users the flexibility to exceed the private prompt usage limits for existing prompts without needing to upgrade their plan. This was our way of thanking you for your early support and trust in our service. However, to ensure the longevity and quality of our services, weve had to align with the original plan specifications. If youve noticed that some of your private prompts are no longer visible, its likely a result of these recent adjustments. This change is particularly relevant if there has been a cancellation or downgrade in your subscription. In such cases, the access to private prompts is now aligned with your current plans limitations. We understand that this transition might be an inconvenience to some, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption this may cause in your workflow. Our team is dedicated to supporting you through this adjustment. If you find that your current plan no longer meets your needs, we encourage you to consider the different plans we offer, which are designed to cater to a range of usage requirements. Your feedback and satisfaction are incredibly important to us. If you have any questions, concerns, or need assistance in choosing a plan that best fits your needs, please dont hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. Heres our official FAQ page with details. We are here to help and ensure that your experience with AIPRM continues to be productive and enjoyable.

And soon AIPRM Cockpit And soon, the Custom Index feature will feed your knowledge base or documents to the AI A word on the Custom Index feature coming up: this will not be for the proverbial PDF to chat with. .Custom Index is created from and for hundreds of pages of documentation or websites for you. The price for this goes from 79 to 99 on January 8 for new purchases. You get the best deal when you buy for a year and lock in the price. Take the chance. The image below that says it all.

Christoph C.

You can use code WINTERLEET17 for 17 off on the monthly AIPRM Elite plan, from the old price. If you go for a year, it comes down to 31 off even. Then the regular old price of 79 will be around, until Jan 8. USE THAT CODE HERE after login Have a great day, Christoph Founder CEO AIPRM Here is the image that says it all. My recommendation 25-Abhay: If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan, then do so soon to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have in store by watching some of the videos here , you get an idea. However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing. But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices before theyre gone. The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to lock in the current old price.
