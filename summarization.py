Hello!

Trust you are doing well. We are back with the new product updates in Predis.aiðŸ˜€ But before we start, 
here is a quick refresher about us- Predis.ai is a powerful combination of ChatGPT, Canvas, and Hoot suite that allows 
you to create almost ready-to-publish but still completely editable social media content in your brand language. We 
are back with new updates!

ðŸš€ Get Ready for Smoother Resizing! We've made some major improvements to our resizing feature, and we can't wait for 
you to try it out. Before, resizing could be a bit of a headache. Templates would often end up looking wonky and 
distorted. Not cool, right? But guess what? We've listened to your feedback and rolled out a much better resizing 
logic. Now, resizing works like a charm in most cases! Whether you're publishing in different sizes or using 
templates for ad creatives , you'll notice a big difference. We're still fine-tuning things, so consider this an 
experiment in progress. But hey, we're all about making things better for you, and this update is just the beginning 
into making multiple ad sizes"""
